# Generic-Algorithms
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic or optimization technique inspired by the process of natural evolution. It is used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. The basic idea is to mimic the process of natural selection, where the best individuals are selected for reproduction to produce.
